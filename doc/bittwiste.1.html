BITTWISTE(1)                General Commands Manual               BITTWISTE(1)



NAME
       bittwiste -- pcap capture file editor

SYNOPSIS
       bittwiste [ -I input ] [ -O output ] [ -L layer ] [ -X payload ]
                 [ -C ] [ -M linktype ] [ -D offset ] [ -R range ]
                 [ -S timeframe ] [ -N repeat ] [ -P seed ] [ -T header ]
                 [ header-specific-options ] [ -h ]

DESCRIPTION
       This document describes the bittwiste program, the pcap(3) capture file
       editor. Bittwiste is designed to work only with  Ethernet  frame,  e.g.
       link  type  DLT_EN10MB  in  pcap(3),  with a maximum frame size of 1514
       bytes which is equivalent to an MTU of 1500 bytes, 14 bytes for  Ether-
       net header.

       Bittwiste can currently edit Ethernet, ARP, IPv4, IPv6, ICMPv4, ICMPv6,
       TCP, and UDP headers. IPv6  packets  with  extension  headers  or  next
       header  field  not matching ICMPv6, TCP, or UDP are not supported; bit-
       twiste will simply write such packets as is to output trace file as  it
       encounters them in the input trace file.

       If  run  with the -X flag, you can append your own payload after any of
       the supported headers; specified using the -L and  -T  flag.  Bittwiste
       will,  if not run with the -C flag, recalculate the checksums for IPv4,
       ICMPv4, ICMPv6, TCP, and UDP headers, except for the last fragment of a
       fragmented IPv4 datagram; bittwiste does not currently support checksum
       correction for the last fragment of a fragmented IPv4 datagram.

       While parsing the packets in an input trace file, bittwiste will  skip,
       i.e.  write to output trace file as is, any truncated packet, for exam-
       ple, an ICMPv4 packet with a captured length of 25 bytes  (we  need  at
       least  28  bytes; 14 bytes for Ethernet header, minimum 20 bytes for IP
       header, and 4 bytes for ICMPv4 header) does not give enough information
       on its ICMPv4 header for bittwiste to read and modify it. In this case,
       you can utilize the -L and -T flag to copy the original  packet  up  to
       its  IP header and append your customized ICMPv4 header and data to the
       packet using the -X flag.  When  specifying  payload  that  covers  the
       ICMPv4,  ICMPv6,  TCP,  or  UDP header and its data, you can use zeros,
       e.g. 0000 for 2 bytes of zeros, for the header checksum which  is  then
       corrected automatically by bittwiste.

       In  order  to simplify the way options are specified, you can only edit
       packets of a specific type supplied to the -T  flag  per  execution  of
       bittwiste  on an input trace file. In addition, the -T flag must appear
       last among the general options which are the -I, -O, -L,  -X,  -C,  -M,
       -D, -R, -S, -N, and -P flag.

OPTIONS
       -I input
              Input  pcap  based trace file. Typically, input should be a file
              path to a pcap based trace file. However, for  convenience,  the
              following  template  names  are also accepted to load trace file
              from one of the built-in templates:

              eth    : Ethernet header
              arp    : ARP header
              ip     : IPv4 header
              ip6    : IPv6 header
              icmp   : ICMPv4 header
              icmp6  : ICMPv6 header
              tcp    : IPv4 TCP header
              ip6tcp : IPv6 TCP header
              udp    : IPv4 UDP header
              ip6udp : IPv6 UDP header

              Example: -I icmp

       -O output
              Output trace file.

       -L layer
              Copy up to the specified layer and discard the  remaining  data.
              Value  for layer must be either 2, 3, or 4 where 2 for Ethernet,
              3 for ARP, IPv4, or IPv6, and 4 for ICMPv4, ICMPv6, TCP, or UDP.

       -X payload
              Append payload in hex digits to the end of each packet.
              Example: -X 0302aad1
              -X flag is ignored if -L and -T flag are not specified.

       -C     Specify this flag to disable checksum correction. Checksum  cor-
              rection is applicable for non-fragmented supported packets only.

       -M linktype
              Replace  the linktype stored in the pcap file header. Typically,
              value for linktype is 1 for Ethernet.
              Example: -M 12 (for raw IP), -M 51 (for PPPoE)

              For the complete list, see:
              https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html

       -D offset
              Delete the specified byte offset from each packet.
              First byte (starting from link layer header) starts from 1.
              -L, -X, -C and -T flag are ignored if -D flag is specified.
              Example: -D 15-40, -D 10, or -D 18-9999

       -R range
              Save only the specified range of packets.
              Example: -R 5-21 or -R 9

       -S timeframe
              Save only the packets within the specified timeframe with up  to
              one-second  resolution  using  DD/MM/YYYY,HH:MM:SS as the format
              for start and end time in timeframe.
              Example: -S 22/10/2006,21:47:35-24/10/2006,13:16:05
              -S flag is evaluated after -R flag.

       -N repeat
              Duplicate packets from the input trace file  repeat  times.  Use
              this flag to create a stream of packets, each with, for example,
              a random tcp sequence number, from a 1-packet trace file.
              Example: -N 100000
              -N flag is evaluated after -R and -S flag.

       -P seed
              Positive integer to seed the random number generator (RNG) used,
              for  example,  to generate random port number. If unset, current
              timestamp will be used as the RNG seed.

              bittwiste uses Mersenne Twister for  high-speed  uniformly  dis-
              tributed random number generation.

       -T header
              Edit  only  the  specified  header. Possible keywords for header
              are, eth, arp, ip, ip6, icmp, icmp6, tcp, or udp. -T  flag  must
              appear last among the general options.

       -h     Print version information and usage.

       header-specific-options
              Each  packet  that  matches  the type supplied to the -T flag is
              modified based on the options described below:

              -c code
                     Code for this ICMPv6 message in integer value  between  0
                     to  255.  For example, code for Time Exceeded message may
                     have one of the following values:

                     0 : hop limit exceeded in transit
                     1 : fragment reassembly time exceeded

              Options for tcp (RFC 9293):

              -s sport or op,np
                     Source port number in integer value between 0  to  65535.
                     If  op  and  np are specified, any instances of op in the
                     source port field will be replaced with np. You can  also
                     use the string 'rand' for a random port number.

                     Example: -s 2000, -s rand, or -s 1000,rand

              -d dport or op,np
                     Destination  port  number  in  integer value between 0 to
                     65535. If op and np are specified, any instances of op in
                     the  destination port field will be replaced with np. You
                     can also use the string 'rand' for a random port number.

                     Example: -d 2000, -d rand, or -d 1000,rand

              -q seq or os,ns
                     Sequence number in integer value between 0 to 4294967295.
                     If  SYN  control bit is set, e.g. character s is supplied
                     to the -f flag, seq represents the initial sequence  num-
                     ber  (ISN)  and the first data byte is ISN + 1. If os and
                     ns are specified, any instances of  os  in  the  sequence
                     number  field  will be replaced with ns. You can also use
                     the string 'rand' for a random sequence number.

                     Example: -q 100000, -q rand, or -q 100000,rand

              -a ack or oa,na
                     Acknowledgment number  in  integer  value  between  0  to
                     4294967295.  If  ACK control bit is set, e.g. character a
                     is supplied to the -f flag, ack represents the  value  of
                     the  next  sequence number that the receiver is expecting
                     to receive. If oa and na are specified, any instances  of
                     oa  in  the  acknowledgment number field will be replaced
                     with na. You can also use the string 'rand' for a  random
                     acknowledgment number.

                     Example: -a 100000, -a rand, or -a 100000,rand

              -f flags
                     Control flags. Possible characters for flags are:

                     - : remove all flags
                     c : congestion window reduced
                     e : explicit congestion notification echo
                     u : urgent pointer field is significant
                     a : acknowledgment field is significant
                     p : push function
                     r : resets the connection
                     s : synchronizes the sequence numbers
                     f : no more data from sender

                     Example: -f s
                     If  any of the flags is specified, all original flags are
                     removed automatically.

              -w win
                     Window size in integer value between 0 to 65535.  If  ACK
                     control  bit  is set, e.g. character a is supplied to the
                     -f flag, win represents the number of data bytes,  begin-
                     ning  with the one indicated in the acknowledgment number
                     field that the receiver is willing to accept.

              -u urg
                     Urgent pointer in integer value between 0  to  65535.  If
                     URG  control  bit is set, e.g. character u is supplied to
                     the -f flag, urg represents a pointer that points to  the
                     first data byte following the urgent data.

              Options for udp (RFC 768):

              -s sport or op,np
                     Source  port  number in integer value between 0 to 65535.
                     If op and np are specified, any instances of  op  in  the
                     source  port field will be replaced with np. You can also
                     use the string 'rand' for a random port number.

                     Example: -s 2000, -s rand, or -s 1000,rand

              -d dport or op,np
                     Destination port number in integer  value  between  0  to
                     65535. If op and np are specified, any instances of op in
                     the destination port field will be replaced with np.  You
                     can also use the string 'rand' for a random port number.

                     Example: -d 2000, -d rand, or -d 1000,rand
