BITTWIST(1)                 General Commands Manual                BITTWIST(1)



NAME
       bittwist -- pcap based ethernet packet generator

SYNOPSIS
       bittwist [ -dvh ] [ -i interface ] [ -s length ] [ -l loop ]
                [ -c count ] [ -p pps ] [ -t gap ] [ -r rate ]
                pcap-file(s)

DESCRIPTION
       This  document describes the bittwist program, the pcap(3) based Ether-
       net packet generator. Bittwist is designed to work  under  Ethernet  II
       (IEEE 802.3) network with an MTU of up to 1500 bytes on 10Mbps (10Base-
       T), 100Mbps (100BASE-TX), or 1000Mbps (1000BASE-T) link speed.  Packets
       are  generated  from saved tcpdump(1) capture file referred to as trace
       file in this document. Some familiarity with tcpdump(1) and  its  basic
       options  are  assumed  in  this document. Since bittwist uses functions
       provided by  pcap(3)  library,  e.g.  pcap_open_live()  and  pcap_send-
       packet(),  to  write  packets onto the network, it may require that you
       have special privileges, e.g. read access to /dev/bpf* on BSD  or  root
       access  on  Linux,  to generate packets or to enumerate network devices
       with, for example, the -d flag.

       Bittwist will, if not run with the -s flag, inject each  packet  up  to
       its actual length (on-wire) instead of its captured length. If the cap-
       tured length is less than the actual  length,  bittwist  will  pad  the
       packet  with zeros up to its actual length prior to injection. Bittwist
       will, if not run with the -p, -t, or -r flag,  inject  packets  from  a
       trace  file  based  on the captured intervals, in particular, the time-
       stamp difference between two adjacent packets,  except  for  the  first
       packet  in a trace file, which is always injected immediately. Bittwist
       is designed to not to interfere with the packet data; it merely read  a
       packet and inject it as is onto the network. If modification is desired
       prior to injection of a packet, you can use the  bittwiste(1)  program,
       which does just that.

OPTIONS
       -d     Print a list of network interfaces available.

       -v     Print timestamp for each packet.

       -vv    Print timestamp and hex data for each packet.

       -i interface
              Send pcap-file(s) out onto the network through interface.

       -s length
              Packet length to send (in bytes). Set length to:

               0 : Send the actual packet length. This is the default.
              -1 : Send the captured length.

              or any other value from 14 to 1514.

       -l loop
              Send  pcap-file(s) out onto the network for loop times. Set loop
              to 0 to send pcap-file(s) until stopped. To stop, type  Control-
              C.

       -c count
              Send  up  to  count packets. Default is to send all packets from
              pcap-file(s).

       -p pps Send pps packets per second. Value for pps must be between 1  to
              1000000.

       -t gap Set  inter-packet gap in seconds, ignoring the captured interval
              between packets in pcap-file(s). Value for gap must be between 1
              to 86400.

       -r rate
              Limit the sending to rate Mbps. Value for rate must be between 0
              to 10000. This flag  is  intended  to  set  the  desired  packet
              throughput.  If  you  want  to send packets at line rate of 1000
              Mbps, try -r 1000. If you want  to  send  packets  without  rate
              limit,  try  -r 0. This flag is typically used with -l 0 to send
              pcap-file(s) until stopped.

       -h     Print version information and usage.

BUGS
       File your bug report and send to:

              Addy Yeow &lt;ayeowch@gmail.com&gt;

       Make sure you are using the latest  stable  version  before  submitting
       your bug report.

       If you run bittwist with -r flag, pcap_sendpacket() may return an error
       with the following error string:

              send: No buffer space available

       We recommend that you adjust the value for -r flag to limit the  packet
       throughput  to  a lower level that is supported by your interface, e.g.
       start from -r 10 to inject packets at a maximum rate of 10Mbps and  ad-
       just the value accordingly.
